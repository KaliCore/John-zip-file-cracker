How to use John the ripper

note: if you download a zip file from the internet and it has a password, it might take a long time to crack because of it's password, it might take up to 12 hours to crack.

first type in terminal; cd <where the zip file is> 
for example; cd Downloads, cd Desktop, you get what i mean.

then type; zip2john <file name.zip>; > hashes
or; zip2john <file name.zip; > hash.txt
for example; zip2john easy.zip > hashes or zip2john eazy.zip > hash.txt
it will create a hashes or hash.txt file,

then type; john -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes or hash.txt
if it say's fopen: /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt: No such file or directory
 you probly don't have the rockyou.txt file in wordlists, but you have rockyou.txt.gz file in there.
to get rockyou.txt, you wanna go to, File System → usr → share  → wordlists → rockyou.txt.gz open it up and extract that to Desktop. After, copy rockyou.txt after extracting, then open wordlists with root and paste rockyou.txt into wordlists.

now run it and wait.
